<h3>Electric energy</h3>
<p>
  Electrical energy is caused by moving electric charges called electrons. The
  faster the charges move, the more electrical energy they carry. As the charges
  that cause the energy are moving, electrical energy is a form of kinetic
  energy. Lightning, batteries and even electric eels are examples of electrical
  energy in action!.
  <br />
</p>

<p>
  The formula for electrical energy is E = V*I*t joules, where V is the
  potential difference, I is the current and t is the time. The formula for
  electrical power is Power (P) = V*I watts, where V is the potential difference
  and I is the current. <br />

<h3>Scatter plot</h3>
<p>
  A scatter plot (aka scatter chart, scatter graph) uses dots to represent
  values for two different numeric variables. The position of each dot on the
  horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point.
  Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables. <br />

  The equation of a line of fit for the given scatter plot is y=mx+b y = m x + b
  , where m is the slope found in step 2 and b is the y-intercept found in step
  3. Slope (m) found in step 2 is 12 .<br />
</p>

<h3>Renewable energy</h3>
<p>
  Renewable energy is energy produced from sources like the sun and wind that
  are naturally replenished and do not run out. Renewable energy can be used for
  electricity generation, space and water heating and cooling, and
  transportation. <br />

<h3>Watt(physical unit)</h3>
<p>
  The watt (abbreviated W) is the International System of Units' (SI) standard
  unit of power (energy per unit time), the equivalent of one jouleper second.
  The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy isdissipated,
  or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated, absorbed, or
  dissipated. <br />
</p>

<p>
  Actually, in physics the unit of measurement of energy is called a joule. The
  equation that we should use to calculate power, then, is watt=joule/second.
  <br />
</p>

<p>Amps (A) x Volts (V) x Power Factor = Watts (W) <br /></p>

<h3>Linnear regresion</h3>
<p>
  What is linear regression? Linear regression analysis is used to predict the
  value of a variable based on the value of another variable. <br />
  The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. <br />
  The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the
  independent variable. <br />
  The independent variable is also the predictor or explanatory variable that
  remains unchanged due to the change in other variables. <br />
</p>

<p>
  The equation has the form Y= a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable (that's
  the variable that goes on the Y axis), X is the independent variable (i.e. it
  is plotted on the X axis), b is the slope of the line and a is the
  y-intercept. <br />
